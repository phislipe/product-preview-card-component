## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

This was fun! Really glad I managed to do both mobile and desktop designs, learned a lot during this process. This was the first time I used the `<picture>` tag, had to do some research to figure out how to change images when transitioning from mobile to desktop. At first, I tried using `hidden= "true"` in HTML, and it wasn't working the way I wanted.

### Useful resources
